        ############
        .. warning::
        
            The current version of ViCE is suitable for developers only. A version
            suitable for designers will be made available next, then finally, one
            that will cater to players. If you are unsure which category you belong
            to, read my blog post on `wtactics.org <http://wtactics.org/vice-versa/>`_.

        ========
        ViCE is made available through stable and unstable releases. For those wanting
        to experiment with new features, feel free to try the unstable release with 
        the understanding that things are expected to break. For those who are 
        patient enough to wait until such features are complete, it is recommended
        that you stick to the stable versions.
