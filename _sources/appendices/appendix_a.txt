Appendix A: GUI Ideas
#####################
This appendix is a scratch-pad of sorts, which serves as a visible
place for me to document design ideas.

    Nothing here is concrete, and this appendix may at some point even be removed.

Interacting with Cards
======================

It would be cool if interacting with cards was done as a series of
motions. I'm careful not to use the term gesture here, as gesture tends
to imply a more exact series of movements at any arbitrary spot. With 
motions, they would be simple (generally a line), and only concerned about
the source and targets.

Key Terms and Notation
======================

Primary Cursor (*)
    On desktops, this is a left-click.
    On mobile devices, this is a tap.

Secondary Cursor (#)
    On desktops, this is a right-click.
    On mobile multi-touch capable devices, this is a two-fingered tap.
    On other mobile devices, this is a long-press.

Drag (=>)
    On desktops, this is a movement of the mouse.
    On mobile devices, this is a sliding of your finger.

Us (U)
    Us, as the player.

Them (T)

The Motions
===========

* Our Card * => Their Card
* Our Card # => Their Card
